          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>The GRAPES library can be used by C applications, and currently
             provides the following functionalities:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <b>network helper</b>, allowing applications developers
                to build P2P applications without caring about the used
                trasport protocol. An implementation of the net helper
                based on the UDP protocol (and running on POSIX systems)
                is currently available, but other implementations are under
                development. Once multiple network helpers are available,
                it will be possible to switch between them (switching, for
                example, between an unreliable transport protocol and a
                reliable one) by simply linking a different net helper
                implementation
            <li>A <b>peer sampling</b> mechanism (called "TopologyManager"
                for historical reasons). This is currently based on a generic
                gossipping protocol (similar to NewsCast), but implementing
                new protocols based on the framework provided by GRAPES
                is quite simple (as an example, the CYCLON protocol has
                already be implemented, but has not been merged in the main
                source repository yet). In the future, it will be possible
                to configure the peer sampling protocol and mechanism at
                initialisation time
            <li>A <b>Peer Set</b> abstraction, which allows to build more
                complex and structured topologies. Filling the various sets
                is currently application's responsibility, but in the future
                this functionality will be implemented using some topology
                management algorithm (such as, for example, T-Man - prototypal
                implementations are available, but they still have to be
                tested and integrated in the library)
            <li>A <b>Chunk Buffer</b> data type, implementing a timed buffer
                where a streaming application can insert the received chunks.
                The current implementation is suitable for live streaming
                applications, automatically removing the chunks from the buffer
                as soon as they become too old (an alternative implementation,
                more suitable for VoD systems, would leave the chunks in the
                buffer for more time)
            <li>A <b>Chunk ID Set</b> data type, allowing the peers to exchange
                information about the chunks owned or needed by each one of
                them. This abstract data type is the basis for various
                signalling mechanisms, and provides some functionalities for
                encoding the contents of a chunk id set in a message, to be
                distributed on the network (so, the application is not forced
                to care about endianess issues, 64bit vs 32bit issues, etc...)
            <li>A <b>Chunk trading</b> mechanism, allowing to encapsulate
                chunks into messages, and to distribute them on the network
                (again, the application is not forced to care about endianess,
                 ets...)
          </ul>
          <p>The library has no special requirements (excepts a working C
             compiler :), and is suitable for embedded systems.</p>
